## How hashcracker can be used?
Let's imagine a situation like this:
You are a blackhat hacker. One day, someone asks you to redirect a government gold shipment to Sweden.

You learn that yesterday a database containing all the data that allows you to log in to the government platform through which the gold supply is managed has been leaked.

You buy leak data for cryptocurrencies and get to work.

You know that passwords are hashed and they are not salty. Unfortunately, you do not know the algorithm in which they were hashed.

This is where HashCracker comes in.
```

```
You run the script, then paste the hash from the leak and wait about 10 seconds (more about this in the technical information)
and voil√†! 
You know the password that allows you to log in to the administrator account and redirect the delivery.
